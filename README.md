# InfoTrack SEO

## Setup and Configuration

Instructions for setting up the project - some instructions are in the Infrastructure ReadMe.

Also, be sure to check out the docs on the frontend website!

I was running the project solution in Visual Studio, using Swagger and Postman to test the calls.

I had 'ui' opened in VSCode and was running it off of there.


## Understanding the Structure:

 - **API Layer (InfoTrack.API):** Entry point, responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
 - **Application Layer (InfoTrack.Application):** Contains core business logic and application services.
 - **Domain Layer (InfoTrack.Domain):** Defines the business domain models and interfaces for repositories and services.
 - **Infrastructure Layer (InfoTrack.Infrastructure):** Manages data access, external service integrations, and other infrastructure concerns.
